# What does this do?
### The purpose of this program is to help with setting up modded project zomboid dedicated servers. It was designed to make getting steamworkshop mod information from your downloaded mods into a text document for use in your dedicated server less stressfull!
1. Run the either the Main .class file or the jar files
2. Follow on screen prompts!
3. Once the program is done running you should have a nice text file with all the info needed for your dedicated server!

When you choose your destination for your text file to be created, it will have the file name "ZomboididModInfo.txt"

As a note, I originally intended for this to just be something to send to individuals I personally know, the goal was make the program accessible via a gui hence the use of jfilechooser.

I later decided, why not upload it?
If anyone ever sees it and its usefull, hope you enjoy!!
